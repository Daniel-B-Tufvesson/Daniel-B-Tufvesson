# About me
I'm a student working on my bachelor in cognitive science. My major interests are AI, NLP and brains. In my spare time I like reading books, exercising, and swimming. I also like to make video games.

I believe that if you can't build something then you don't understand it. Reading books and papers may give me the false impression that I understand something, but code does not lie. That is why I try to implement the AI systems that I study.
